# Recording Setup

This guide explains how we do record our meetups. There are two variations. The first one is only for recording. The second one for recording and streaming at the same time.

# Recording

Make sure you have all the necessary pieces:

1. Camera
2. Wireless microphone
3. Tripod

Make sure the SD card is empty or at least enough space available. If you run solely on battery make sure it's fully charged. You can also plug the camera. It will work even without the battery, but we recommend to have the battery in the camera and power connected.

## Connect everything

1. Mount the receiver onto the Camera
2. Connect the receiver output of the wireless microphone to the camera `Mic` input
3. Place the camera on the tripod and fixate the tripod!
4. Connect the camera to the power plug
5. Attach the microphone to the speaker or the test person

## Testing

1. Plug some earphones into the camera and press recording.
2. Press recording on the camera. The speaker should start presenting and you should hear a clear voice in the earphones.

Now you are good to go!

## Pro Tips

- Ask the speaker to record their screen during the presentation. This way you have another high quality video source which you can use for focusing on a slide or demo when cutting it together. Thanks to Roland for this tip.
- The camera is setup with a frequency rate that it works well the Sektor5 beamer. If you record somewhere else test there is no flickering during recording. Please reset it to the current setting once you bring it back.

## Wrapping up after the event

After an successful event copy the videos from the SD to your computer. Once you you have done that please remove all your videos for the next person to use it. If you have used the batteries please make sure they are fully charged before you leave.
